This stems from my passion for problem-solving and my drive to see projects through to completion.

While this intense focus allows me to produce high-quality work and innovative solutions, I've recognized the need to balance this with better time management and a broader perspective on project priorities. To address this, I've been:

1. Implementing stricter time-boxing techniques to allocate specific periods for different tasks.
2. Regularly stepping back to reassess project priorities and ensure I'm aligning with overall team and organizational goals.
3. Actively seeking feedback from colleagues and supervisors to maintain a well-rounded view of my work and its impact.

This self-awareness and the steps I'm taking to improve have actually enhanced my project management skills and my ability to collaborate effectively with teams. It's an ongoing process, but I've already seen positive results in terms of increased productivity and more balanced project outcomes."""
